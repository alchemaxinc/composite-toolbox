# Composite Toolbox

## 📦 Available Actions

- **[check-changes](./check-changes/)** - Check if specified files have changes in the working directory
- **[checkout-and-setup](./checkout-and-setup/)** - Common repository checkout and Git configuration in one step
- **[create-pr](./create-pr/)** - Create a new branch, commit files, and open a pull request
